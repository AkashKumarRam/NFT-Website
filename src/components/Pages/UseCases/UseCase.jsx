              NFTs have the potential to revolutionize the movie industry by
              providing a new way for artists and platforms to monetize and
              protect their intellectual property. NFTs can be issued for movie
              IP, such as limited edition clips, posters, or even a unique
              version of a film, giving fans an exclusive digital asset to
              collect and trade. Using blockchain technology,ensures that the
              movie IP remains secure and is not subject to piracy or copyright
              infringement. Furthermore, artists and platforms can receive a
              share of profits from subsequent sales or licensing of the NFTs,
              creating new revenue streams and increasing the overall value of
              the movie IP. Overall NFTs offer a powerful tool for artists and
              platforms in the movie industry.
